init:
for each clique c in the tree
    compute the factor of c given vars of c (product of factors with prob taken from table)

apply belief propagation, for a given query
choose a node in the tree as the root R, now graph becomes directed
do upward pass
    from each kid to root
do downward pass
    from root to each kid

TODO:
- construct factors from prob distr
- compute the factor for each clique in clique tree
- apply belief propagation
